	<p> 3/2/2018 <br /> The first game I started making was a text based rpg, called Journey of Kethrum. I later began to develop a graphical version of it, but you can read all about that in future updates.
	It grew to a little over 3k lines of code. I remember the bugs I had encountered, finding solutions. The thing I liked most about programming was overcoming all of those bugs.
	Looking back, the source file is very messy, and is littered with repetitive code. I'll probably come back to it at some point, and clean it up. </p>

	<p> \t I decided to use <strong> SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) </strong> to handle the rendering. At the time though, I found the process of linking difficult.
	After failing my first attempt, I tried out SFML, and Allegro, but the same thing happened. I went back to SDL once more, this time getting it right. My first graphical program was a pong clone.
	This is also something I'd like to revisit. Before I started the graphic rendition, I had wrote a small tile editor program in small basic. For some reason, I couldn't get the file I/0 to work,
	so I made a custom tile creator. I adapted it to SDL (without the custom tile creator, I just loaded images), planning to make it top down style. <br /><br />
	I began adding more elements to it, like typing in commands in the cmd console to change the selected texture, change pensize, etc. It was around when I added collision that my computer froze
	and crashed, <i> while I was building my source file </i>. All of the class files I had made were safe, but my main file was completely wiped. And so, I began recoding it. This time around,
	my code was a lot more organized and structured. I didn't like going to the cmd console to type in commands, so I loaded up the ttf library and made an in-game command console.
	I added new commands, like fill, setMapX, loadMap, and more. I added a gui to make map editing easier. I made a map saver and loader. But as I continued, the code became tangled and messy.
	I eventually scrapped it all (not really, it's still there, I just made a new project) and started anew. <br /><br />
	This third iteration was much more successful than the other two. The first thing I did was create a new library for my gui. First I made the buttons and textboxes, which I found easy.
	The others were more complicated; dropmenu, treemenu, and logmenu. Then, I updated my character sprite, and added different skins and hair styles. I made a character customization screen.
	After that, I decided that since I had already made the tile editor before <i> twice </i>, that I should create the battle system this time. I decided to make a script loader to make my enemies'
	behaviors more unique. As it was my first time doing something like this, it felt a bit difficult, but I eventually finished a working version. After that, I went and made the tile editor. <br />
	Here are some very early screenshots I took (From the second iteration, after my main was wiped, and before I started a clean slate. </p>
