	<p style="color:#FFFFFF"> 3/2/2018 <br /> Hey, my name is Wolfenrahd. I am currently developing this site to expand my skill set and build up a portfolio. <br />
	I plan on showcasing games I will/have created, as long with music and art in the future. I may collaborate with some others that I know, but for the most part I am 
	focusing on single-man projects. I do not want to have to rely on others to make art and/or music. I know that my individual skill in each area isn't the greatest, but hopefully
	I'll be able to document my progress on this site. <br />
	<!--This site is still a work in process, and I plan to add a lot more features, but in the meantime, feel free to check out some of my games--></p>
